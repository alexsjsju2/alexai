# Lorel Axun - Backend Server\n\nThis server provides a WebSocket endpoint that bridges the web-based terminal (`index.html`) with a real shell process on the host machine.\n\n## Setup\n\n1.  **Install Dependencies:**\n    Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run the following command in the project directory:\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n\n2.  **Start the Server:**\n    To start the server, run:\n    ```bash\n    npm start\n    ```\n    The server will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n## Usage\n\n1.  Open `index.html` in your browser (or navigate to `http://localhost:3000` if the server is running).\n2.  In the terminal, type the following command to connect:\n    ```\n    connect ws://localhost:3000/shell\n    ```\n3.  You are now connected to a real shell running on the server.
